**Welcome to Colorado Tech Community!**

With Denver Dev's reaching its end of life, we really wanted to supply new server for the massive and amazing community to go next! We are happy to bring you Colorado Tech Community! Who this server is for.

- üèîÔ∏è **You Definitely Don't have to be a Denver-ite**

We want to welcome anybody from anywhere in the world. We wanted to maintain some level of geo-location in our name because we want to include as many people from the previous community as possible. No matter where you are located if you have a good reason to be here, then you are welcome!

- ‚å®Ô∏è **Not Just Developers**

You definitely do not have to be a Developer to join Colorado Tech Community! We do want you to be tech adjacent in some capacity: designers, project/product managers, QA, Learning to Code etc... This just helps us narrow down the scope of "Why this server".
