# The CTC Way

As you make friends on CTC, please try to keep in mind the way we like to act toward one another. These aren't strictly rules, but we hope they portray the kind of community we are trying to build here, and how we're trying to make this place great for everyone.

## Inclusive Behavior

Being inclusive is not always easy. In order to be great at this we need to consider at least the following about the people we interact with and the words we choose:

- Culture
- Ethnicity
- Religion
- Economic Background
- Disabilities
- Gender Identity
- Age
- Political Beliefs
- Sexual Orientation
- Trauma
- The history behind the words we choose

Just know our goal is not to punish people for genuinely trying their best and missing the mark sometimes. We want to treat communication like a **skillset to be improved** and NOT a **ruleset to be followed** so we can strengthen each-other's healthy communication skills and grow as communities / individuals. Here are some guidelines to help you be more inclusive, hopefully this information helps well outside the scope of Colorado Tech Community!

- **Know your audience.** Not everything you say in every context has to be inclusive to everybody in the entire world, but make an effort to know who you're talking to, and make sure you're being inclusive to them.

Scenario : you're bringing up an advanced topic with a junior developer -- like pointers, or the inverse square root algorithm from Doom

- In Your Brain üß†: You may think you are bestowing knowledge upon them, and helping them grow as a developer.
- Reality ü•∫: you might not be helping them, and you might be aggravating their imposter syndrome.
- To Fix This ‚úÖ: Check to see if anything they say validates they are actually soaking in the information you are giving out. In an education environment we call this a "check for understanding".

Scenario: You're a senior developer going into the weeds in a public thread with another senior developer of eight years.

- In Your Brain üß†: This conversation is between you and them, and you're just trying to defend a good opinion you are passionate about.
- Reality ü•∫: While you're totally in your right mind to be having this discussion this way you may also be making the thread hard to follow, or making it scary for less skilled people to engage with the community in the future.
- To Fix This ‚úÖ: Consider moving the conversation to a contained subject thread. You can also consider going out of your way to make sure juniors know that this is some pretty advanced stuff and that it's totally ok to not understand the conversation. Another strong factor is how you engage with juniors outside of the conversation entirely.

- **Be kind and clear.** Since communication can be easily misinterpreted over a screen, it can be hard to judge intent or attitude. Be polite and friendly when you meet someone for the first time. Prefer being _clear_ to being _expressive_ if you don't know how something will make another person feel.

- **Be careful with sarcasm.** In many cultures, sarcasm can be a form of endearment, but as a conversational tool it should be weilded carefully. Often somebody's background might not make them as receptive to sarcasm. Remember to know your audience, armed with the knowledge that these things can affect whether or not your sarcasm is actually received as sarcasm:

  - Language Barriers
  - Mental Predispositions
  - Cultural Differences

- **Be supportive.** When someone is struggling, offer to help. Remember to be respectful and not patronizing.

  Scenario: "I'm having trouble with this, can you help me?"

  - ‚úÖ "Can you show me what came up through a quick google search so we can grok through it together?"
  - ‚ùå "You should just Google it"

  Scenario: "I had a really rough weekend, someone close to me is very ill"

  - ‚úÖ "I'm really sorry to hear that, I'm here for you if you need to talk"
  - ‚ùå "ooh that sucks"

- **Inclusive Language**
  Try to use language that isn't accidentally exclusionary, there's a ton of this baked into our pre-existing day to day dialect, and while unlearning it can feel uncomfortable, once it becomes habit you will barely notice the difference.

  - ‚úÖ "Hey Guys!"
  - ‚úÖ "Hey Everybody!"
  - ‚ùå "Hey Folks!"

  _This extends to the memes/gifs you share as well, if you're not sure if something is offensive, don't share it._

- **Avoid Offensive Slang or Idoms**

The English Language is pretty massive, and there may be words that you had no idea were even offensive! You should know most of these words, but if you're not sure, find a synonym that feels safer.

- **Avoid "well, actually":** This is an unkind way to correct someone which tends to hurt peoples' feelings.
- **Avoid subtle -isms or microaggressions:** For example, the phrase, "it's so easy my grandmother can do it," exhibits both sexism and ageism.
- **Avoid exclusionary language:** Strive to avoid anything else that makes other people feel unwelcome, uncomfortable, or unwanted.

## How To Disagree Civilly

- **Name-calling and personal insults.** It's not bad to attack logic or ideas, but it's not okay to attack people. If you're not sure if something is an attack, ask yourself: "Is this something I would say to someone's face?" If the answer is no, it's probably not okay to say it online.
- **Unwanted or unwelcome interaction.** When someone asks you to leave them alone, respect their wishes. Most of the time we will consider this [Being a Jerk](/code-of-conduct#3-respect-other-people--dont-be-a-jerk)
