# The CTC Way

As you make friends on CTC, please try to keep in mind the way we like to act toward one another. These aren't strictly rules, but we hope they portray the kind of community we are trying to build here, and how we're trying to make this place great for everyone.

## Inclusive Behavior

- **Inclusive Behavior:**
  Being inclusive is difficult for many people, our goal is not to punish people for trying their best and missing the mark sometimes. Here are some guidelines to help you be more inclusive, hopefully this information helps well outside the scope of Colorado Tech Community!

### The Do's âœ…

- **Know your audience.** Not everything you say in every context has to be inclusive, but make an effort to know who you're talking to, and make sure you're being inclusive to them. For example, if you're bringing up an advanced topic with a junior developer -- like pointers, or the inverse square root algorithm from Doom -- you might not be helping them, and you might be aggravating their imposter syndrome. If you're going into the weeds in a public thread with a senior developer of eight years, consider letting juniors know that that they shouldn't feel bad for not knowing this sort of thing yet. Something tricky is on a discord server your audience is a moving target. Use your best judgement to make sure you're being inclusive to everyone, and if you're not sure you can always ask ðŸ˜„.

- **Be kind and clear.** Since communication can be easily misinterpreted over a screen, it can be hard to judge intent or attitude. Be polite and friendly when you meet someone for the first time. Prefer being _clear_ to being _expressive_ if you don't know how something will make another person feel.
- **Be supportive.** When someone is struggling, offer to help. Remember to be respectful and not patronizing.
- **Be inclusive.** We want tech to be a place where everyone can thrive. Choose to say "hey, folks" rather than "hey, guys." Try to include people in the jokes and memes that you share. Avoid slang or idioms that might carry negative connotations about someone else's culture. When you use jargon or acronyms, explain them for people who don't know them yet.

### The Dont's ðŸ”´

- **Avoid "well, actually":** This is an unkind way to correct someone which tends to hurt peoples' feelings.
- **Avoid subtle -isms or microaggressions:** For example, the phrase, "it's so easy my grandmother can do it," exhibits both sexism and ageism.
- **Avoid exclusionary language:** Strive to avoid anything else that makes other people feel unwelcome, uncomfortable, or unwanted.

## How To Disagree Civilly

- **Name-calling and personal insults.** It's not bad to attack logic or ideas, but it's not okay to attack people. If you're not sure if something is an attack, ask yourself: "Is this something I would say to someone's face?" If the answer is no, it's probably not okay to say it online.
  {/* - **Unwanted or unwelcome interaction.** When someone asks you to leave them alone, respect their wishes. Most of the time we will consider this [being a Jerk](/code-of-conduct#3-respect-other-people--dont-be-a-jerk) */}
