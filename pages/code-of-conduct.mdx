# Rules

Welcome to Colorado Tech Community! Please review these rules before participating in our community.

## 1. Follow the Discord rules 

Our community operates on Discord, so please respect the [Discord Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) and [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms).

## 2. No harassment or bigotry

This is a harassment-free place for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of other members in any form. 

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Users asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

## 3. Respect other people -- don't be a jerk

CTC is a community of professionals and friends, and we want to build a safe space for everyone to interact. Please help us by following these guidelines:

- **Be kind.** Since we're often communicating through screens, it can be hard to judge intent or attitude. Be polite and friendly first. Remember that talking with someone online often causes miscommunication -- prefer emojis to sarcasm.
- **Be inclusive.** We want tech to be a place where everyone can thrive. Choose to say "hey, folks" rather than "hey, guys." Include people in the jokes and memes that you share. Avoid slang or idioms that might carry negative connotations about someone else's culture. When you use jargon or acronyms, explain them for people who might not know them yet.
- **Be supportive.** When someone is struggling, offer to help. Remember to be respectful and not patronizing.

The following behaviors are not allowed. If you see any of these, please flag them to an admin:

- **Name-calling and personal insults.** We have a zero-tolerance policy for harassment.
- **Unwanted or unwelcome interaction.** When people ask you to leave them alone, respect their wishes.
- **Exclusionary behavior:**
  - **No "well, actually:"** This is an unkind way to correct someone which tends to hurt peoples' feelings.
  - **No subtle -isms or microaggressions:** Phrases like "it's so easy my grandmother can do it" come with both sexism and ageism.
  - **No exclusionary language:** Strive to avoid anything else that makes other people feel unwelcome, uncomfortable, or unwanted.

## 4. Debates and arguments

In our industry, we often debate the pros and cons of various technical choices. This is OK and often creates a productive discussion. We want you to feel safe discussing these topics here with other users.

When discussions get heated, please remember to focus on the arguments and not the people you're talking to. Users who act like a jerk in an argument may be asked to step back and cool down.

- âœ… Emacs keybindings aren't my favorite. I prefer to use Vim.
- ðŸ”´ Only idiots use Rust! It's an overhyped language with no future.

## 5. Keep content safe for work

As a group of professionals in tech, we want to make sure that people can touch base with our community while in a workplace setting.

- âœ… Cursing
- ðŸ”´ Sexualized imagery
- ðŸ”´ Sexually explicit content
- ðŸ”´ Violent content
- ðŸ”´ Illegal content

When in doubt, use the [Discord spoiler feature](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022320632-Spoiler-Tags-) to hide your link or attachment. (Wrap your content in `||`, e.g. `||spoiler content||`, to hide it from view.)

## 6. No spam or unsolicited promotion

Don't post in CTC about giveaways, pyramid schemes, or stuff you're trying to sell or promote. If you think it's relevant to our community, message the admins to ask before posting.

# Moderation Policies

The admins of CTC are here to make sure that people have a fun and safe time together. They are not here to enforce a specific regime or abuse their power, and they are expected to work toward building our community.

Possible actions that admins may take against users include:

- Speaking to the user
- Warning the user
- Temporarily banning the user ("time-out")
- Permanently banning the user

Admins are expected to use their best judgment to make these decisions. When possible, admins will collaborate as a group when deciding what action to take. When necessary, admins are empowered to take the actions necessary to keep the community safe.

If you think that an admin is treating someone unfairly, please reach out to someone else on the moderation team. They will start a conversation and figure out what is going on.
