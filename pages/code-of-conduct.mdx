# Code of Conduct

## Rules

Welcome to Colorado Tech Community! Please review these rules before participating in our community.

### 1. Follow the Discord rules

Our community operates on Discord, so please respect the [Discord Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) and [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms).

### 2. No harassment or bigotry

This is a harassment-free place for everyone, regardless of sex, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of other members in any form.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to any of those, as well as sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Users asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

### 3. Respect other people â€“ don't be a jerk

CTC is a community of professionals and friends, and we want to build a safe space for everyone to interact. Please help us by **being respectful of other users at all times.** In a broader sense, please do your best to **not be a jerk.** See **[The CTC Way](#the-ctc-way)** below for more on this.

The following behaviors are not allowed. If you experience or witness any of these, and attempts to relieve the situation are unsuccessful â€“ or don't feel safe or appropriate â€“ please flag an admin or moderator so they can address it.

- **Name-calling and personal insults.** We have a zero-tolerance policy for harassment.
- **Unwanted or unwelcome interaction.** When someone asks you to leave them alone, respect their wishes.
- **Exclusionary behavior:**
  - **No "well, actually":** This is an unkind way to correct someone which tends to hurt peoples' feelings.
  - **No subtle -isms or microaggressions:** For example, the phrase, "it's so easy my grandmother can do it," exhibits both sexism and ageism.
  - **No exclusionary language:** Strive to avoid anything else that makes other people feel unwelcome, uncomfortable, or unwanted.

### 4. Debates and arguments

In our industry, we often debate the pros and cons of various technical choices. This is good, as it creates a productive discussion. We want you to feel safe discussing these topics here with other users.

When discussions get heated, please remember to focus on the arguments and not the people you're talking to. Users who act like a jerk in an argument may be asked to step back and cool down.

- âœ… Emacs keybindings aren't my favorite. I prefer to use Vim.
- ðŸ”´ Only idiots use Rust! It's an overhyped language with no future.

### 5. Keep content safe for work

As a group of professionals in tech, we want to make sure that people can touch base with our community while in a workplace setting.

- âœ… Cursing
- ðŸ”´ Sexualized imagery
- ðŸ”´ Sexually explicit content
- ðŸ”´ Violent content
- ðŸ”´ Illegal content

When in doubt, use the [Discord spoiler feature](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022320632-Spoiler-Tags-) to hide your link or attachment. (Wrap your content in `||`, e.g. `||spoiler content||`, to hide it from view.)

### 6. No spam or unsolicited promotion

Don't post in CTC about giveaways, pyramid schemes, or stuff you're trying to sell or promote. If you think it's relevant to our community, message the admins to ask before posting.

## The CTC Way

As you make friends on CTC, please try to keep in mind the way we like to act toward one another. These aren't strictly rules, but we hope they portray the kind of community we are trying to build here, and how we're trying to make this place great for everyone.

- **Be kind and clear.** Since communication can be easily misinterpreted over a screen, it can be hard to judge intent or attitude. Be polite and friendly when you meet someone for the first time. Prefer being *clear* to being *expressive* if you don't know how something will make another person feel.
- **Be supportive.** When someone is struggling, offer to help. Remember to be respectful and not patronizing.
- **Be inclusive.** We want tech to be a place where everyone can thrive. Choose to say "hey, folks" rather than "hey, guys." Try to include people in the jokes and memes that you share. Avoid slang or idioms that might carry negative connotations about someone else's culture. When you use jargon or acronyms, explain them for people who don't know them yet.
- **Know your audience.** Not everything you say in every context has to be inclusive, but make an effort to know who you're talking to, and make sure you're being inclusive to them. For example, if you're bringing up an advanced topic with a junior developer -- like pointers, or the inverse square root algorithm from Doom -- you might not be helping them, and you might be aggravating their imposter syndrome. If you're going into the weeds in a public thread with a senior developer of eight years, think about letting juniors know that that they shouldn't feel bad for not knowing this sort of thing yet.

## Moderation Policies

The admins of CTC are here to make sure that people have a fun and safe time together. They are not here to enforce a specific regime or abuse their power, and they are expected to work toward building our community.

Possible actions that admins may take against users include:

- Speaking to the user
- Warning the user
- Temporarily banning the user ("time-out")
- Permanently banning the user

Admins are expected to use their best judgment to make these decisions. When possible, admins will collaborate as a group when deciding what action to take. When necessary, admins are empowered to take the actions necessary to keep the community safe.

If you think that an admin is treating someone unfairly, please reach out to someone else on the moderation team. They will start a conversation and figure out what is going on.
