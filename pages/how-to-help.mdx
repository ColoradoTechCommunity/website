# How To Help

In order to keep this community a wonderful and safe place for everybody involved, we need your help! Here are some things you can do to help us out:

## Report Content / People

You can report something to the moderators using our discord bot called [Carl Bot](https://docs.carl.gg/)

To report someone/something do the following steps:

1. Type in "/moderation report"
2. Send us whatever message you want
3. Although a message will pop up in the server you are in for you, nobody else should be able to see it.

_Note: Moderators will see your profile information when you report to us, it is not anonymous. All feedback goes into a mods-only channel so that way the public will not see it_

For an example reporting check out this video ðŸ˜ƒ
