# How to Help

In order to keep this community a wonderful and safe place for everybody involved, we need your help! Here are some things you can do to help us out.

## Report things

You can report something (or someone) to the moderators using our friendly neighborhood Discord bot, [@Carl-bot](https://docs.carl.gg/).

To report something, type in `/moderation report` followed by a message describing what you're reporting. A message will pop up in the channel you are in, verifying that your report has been submitted, but don't worry: it's only visible to you.

Reports are sent to a moderator-only channel. Moderators will see your profile information when you report to us, so it is not anonymous, but the public will not see anything.

For an example of reporting, check out this video:

## Invite your friends

If you have friends that were a part of Denver Devs, but haven't seen the announcement yet, please invite them to the server! Don't be spammy on our behalf, but if you think someone probably missed the announcement and that it would be appropriate, we want to make sure they know where to go.

We want to make sure that everyone who's been part of the community before can still be a part of the community now.

## Interested in becoming a moderator?

Just shoot one of us a message! You can find us by checking the sidebar for users with the Admins or Moderators role.
