# How to Help

In order to keep this community a wonderful and safe place for everybody involved, we need your help! Here are some things you can do to help us out.

## Report things

You can report something (or someone) to the moderators using our friendly neighborhood Discord bot, [@Carl-bot](https://docs.carl.gg/).

To report something, type in `/moderation report` followed by a message describing what you're reporting. A message will pop up in the channel you are in, verifying that your report has been submitted, but don't worry: it's only visible to you.

Reports are sent to a moderator-only channel. Moderators will see your profile information when you report to us, so it is not anonymous, but the public will not see anything.

For an example of reporting, check out this video:

<div
	style={{
		position: "relative",
		paddingBottom: "64.98194945848375%",
		height: 0,
	}}
>
	<iframe
		src="https://www.loom.com/embed/6257c72f19824f62ba9dbce74ce3876e"
		frameborder="0"
		webkitallowfullscreen
		mozallowfullscreen
		allowfullscreen
		style={{
			position: "absolute",
			top: 0,
			left: 0,
			width: "100%",
			height: "100%",
		}}
	></iframe>
</div>
